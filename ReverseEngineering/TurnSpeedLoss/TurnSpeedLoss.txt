f1: 1 (somwhow precomputed)
f0: TurningSpeedLossMultiplier thing
f2: percentage of maxSpeed rounded to singe percision float, than squared and than multiplied by absolute stick input [now called MagicStickValue]
f3: -0.000462963 (fiexed)
f4: pulled from player struct (seems to be 0 regardless | undocumented)
f5: 1
f6: normalisedStickInput (absolute value)


Generating f0:
-There is a static value loaded
-Load base turning Speed loss (0.8)
-SpeedLoss gear based is loaded
-0.0253073 is loaded

PRE-STEPS:
-This will be f0 for the above calcs (Add 0.8 to the gear struct thingy and use it for further calcs (in theory also multiply by f1 but f1 seems to be 1))

FORMULA (guess)

STEP 0 (Calculate TurningSpeedLossMultiplier)

KNOWN_INPUTS:
([float] GearTurningSpeedLossMultiplier)

UNKOWN_INPUTS:
([float?] unknownPrecompute[fixed? = 1?])	[unkownPrecompute is from register f1]

[float] TurningSpeedLossMultiplier = (GearTurningSpeedLossMultiplier + 0.8f) * unkownPrecompute	



STEP 1 (Calculate MagicStickValue)

KNOWN_INPUTS:
([double] MaxSpeed, [float] StickInput)

UNKNOWN_INPUTS:
([const?] [float?] percentageModifier)

[float] MagicStickValue = ((([float](MaxSpeed * PercentageModifier))^2) * abs(StickInput)


PERSONAL THEORY:

1: Cube absolute StickInput
