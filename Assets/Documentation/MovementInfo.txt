Aceleration:
Rate at which player acels towards the current MaxSpeed. Rate might be based of the difference between current speed and MaxSpeed.
Acceleration gets cancled when turning.

FastAccel:
Increased Accel when below the Fast Accel Threshhold. Does not get cancled by turning.



Deceleration (MaxSpeed):
The rate at which you decelerate back to your current maximum speed when above that value. This rate increases with your current maximum speed. 
Formula: 
Max Speed > 200: Speed loss per frame = ( (Overmax Speed / 60 )^2 +0.2)/1000
Max Speed < 200: Speed loss per frame = (( Overmax Speed / (260 - Max Speed) )^2 +0.2 )/1000
Overmax Speed = Speed - MaxSpeed (while Speed > MaxSpeed)
Example: High Booster with Sonic has 157 top speed at level 1, and 183 top speed at level 3, therefore it decelerates faster at level 3 while cruising. 
However at all levels, its boost speed is above 200, so it always decelerates at the same rate while boosting regardless of level.
Decel is capped at 10 per frame.


MaxSpeed:
If you are above or below your max speed, you begin to acclerate/decelerate back to it. Max speed depends on the state you are in. The rate of accel/decel depends on how great the difference is between your current and max speed.
While cruising: Max Speed = Top Speed
While boosting: Max Speed = Boost Speed
While riding turbulence: Max Speed = 250 + bonuses from twirl and turbulence tricks
While Flying: Max Speed = Top Speed (You will still decel below Top Speed but higher top speed results in lower decel)
While Falling: Max Speed= Top Speed

Speed:
The Speed at which the player is currently moving. (Meters/Second according to dev but seems to be km/h)

TopSpeed:
This value is determined by a combination of character and gear. This will usually be used as the MaxSpeed value.

Drift(State):
Disables most kinds of Accel (including FastAccel), but also does not inherrently contribute Decel (regular Decel still applies). When the player Turns(Input) in the DriftDirection regular TurnDecel gets applied. 


BOOSTING

Boost:
Speed is set to BoostSpeed. MaxSpeed is set to BoostSpeed. Player enters BoostState (Duration is based of BoostDuration).

BoostSpeed:
Value used for MaxSpeed while boosting.

BoostState:
Duration is based of BoostDuration. Player can not extend BoostState / reenter it while in BoostState. BoostState can be extied by:
a) After passing the BoostDuration
b) Charging Jump
c) Becoming Airborne



Cruising:
Default state.
